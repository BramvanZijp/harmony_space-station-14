	## Rule 7: Validhunting

	It is only the job of Security to stop antagonists. If you are not a member of Security, then hunting Antagonists is not something you should be doing. You may not drop your job, or go out of your way, to hunt Antagonists. You may, however, protect yourself or others from Antagonist attack if you happen to witness it.

  In the case of protecting yourself from an antagonist, donâ€™t make an extended effort to chase down an antagonist. If they are no longer an active threat to you or others near you, it is not your job to go and chase them down. Let security handle the antagonists whenever possible.

  Any form of non-antagonist sentient animals must acquire permission from the Head of Security and Captain before assisting with security matters. You are allowed to defend yourself if either you or your owner are attacked, but valid hunting rules still apply unless you have been given permission.

  Antagonists that seek to destroy the station itself or kill the entire crew are exempt from the valid hunting rule, as they may require dozens of crew members to stop them. However, doctors should generally try to treat patients first and fight second. This goes for all jobs; engineers keeping the lights on may save more lives in the end.

  Evidence of antagonist activity is required before you take steps to treat anyone as an antagonist. For example, just having syndicate pajamas is not proof of an antagonist.
