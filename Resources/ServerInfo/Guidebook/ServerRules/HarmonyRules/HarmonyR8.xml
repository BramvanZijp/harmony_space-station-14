	## Rule 8: Erotic Content

	Generally, avoid anything that can come off as erotic. Don’t say things like, “They’re raping me!” Lighter forms of affection like hugs and kisses are appropriate, but anything more than that will be crossing the line. Keep things platonic.

  Sexual terms may be used in the form of insults, but keep them tasteful. Things like “captain can go fuck themselves” but avoid going into too much detail with these insults.
