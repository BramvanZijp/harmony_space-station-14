	## Rule 3: Maintaining a Respectful Environment

	Under no circumstances is OOC harassment of another player allowed, regardless of who the victim is. Repeated IC harassment with little to no reason can be considered metagrudging;

  Racial, Homophobic, Ethnic, Religious, etc, slurs are not allowed ICly or OOCly. Terms such as "f-slur" and "n-slur", or any variations on them are strictly prohibited. Speciesism is also prohibited.

  Be respectful to everyone. Every character is played by a real human being. Frustration is natural and a part of roleplay, but actively harassing someone can leave a bad impression. Reserve anger in OOC, and try to remain constructive whenever possible.
