	## Rule 2: SSD Players

	SSD Players are players that have disconnected from the game. They can be identified by examining them, which will reveal yellow text indicating they might return.

  You may not touch or interact with people under the influence of 'Sudden Sleep Disorder' except to pull them to a Cryosleeper, to provide medical care to SSD players, such as medication or surgery, or to remove them from an immediate life threatening situation, such as a plasma fire.

  Antagonists may loot non-antag SSD players, but looting the captain, who clearly crashed in a public hall, is not fun gameplay for anyone. If they are your target, feel free to do what you have to. If the person goes SSD immediately after an arrest, you are free to continue processing and brigging them as if they were still awake.

  If you believe an SSD person needs to be interacted with (such as an SSD Captain needing to have their equipment removed), ask the Administrators first.
